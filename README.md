# Python-Facedetection-EV3
Enables you to use your EV3 as a facetracker. Uses the Dnn method of OpenCv and an external script (EV3BT) found in an Geek Droppings article written by Maksym Shyte. You need to enter the right COM Port of your connected EV3 (face_det.py line 10) in order to connect to it. Strip an Usb-Webcam onto it and it should work. Connection to EV3 gives strange errors sometimes, in this case check if the COM Port is right and restart the code.
